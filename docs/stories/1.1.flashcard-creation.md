# Story 1.1: Core Flashcard Creation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** language learner,
**I want** to create and design flashcards,
**so that** I can build my own vocabulary study materials

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can create a new flashcard with front and back content
2. User can edit flashcard content after creation
3. User can save flashcards to the system
4. User can view their created flashcards
5. System validates flashcard content is not empty
6. Flashcards are stored persistently in the database

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Set up flashcard data model (AC: 1, 3, 6)
  - [ ] Define flashcard schema in MongoDB
  - [ ] Create flashcard entity/model class
  - [ ] Set up database connection and configuration
- [ ] Task 2: Create flashcard API endpoints (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - [ ] POST /api/flashcards - Create flashcard endpoint
  - [ ] GET /api/flashcards - List user flashcards endpoint
  - [ ] PUT /api/flashcards/{id} - Update flashcard endpoint
  - [ ] Add validation middleware for flashcard content
- [ ] Task 3: Implement flashcard service layer (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  - [ ] Create flashcard service class
  - [ ] Implement create flashcard business logic
  - [ ] Implement update flashcard business logic
  - [ ] Implement get flashcards business logic
  - [ ] Add content validation logic
- [ ] Task 4: Add authentication integration (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Link flashcards to authenticated users
  - [ ] Ensure user can only access their own flashcards
- [ ] Task 5: Unit testing (AC: All)
  - [ ] Test flashcard model validation
  - [ ] Test API endpoints
  - [ ] Test service layer methods
  - [ ] Test authentication and authorization

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the first story in the project.

### Data Models
Based on the system architecture requirements:
- **MongoDB Database**: Primary data store for flashcards [Source: architecture/3-backend-services.md]
- **Flashcard Schema**: Should include front content, back content, user ID, creation/modification timestamps
- **User Association**: Each flashcard must be linked to the creating user for proper data isolation

### API Specifications
From system architecture:
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js/NestJS based API Gateway [Source: architecture/2-system-architecture.md]
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 and JWT for securing API endpoints [Source: architecture/3-backend-services.md]
- **REST API Pattern**: Standard REST endpoints for CRUD operations

### Component Specifications
No specific frontend component specifications found in architecture docs for this story.

### File Locations
Based on current project structure:
- Source files should be placed under `src/main/` directory structure
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs for detailed file organization
- Suggest following standard Node.js/NestJS patterns for API development

### Technical Constraints
From architecture documents:
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence [Source: architecture/3-backend-services.md]
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3-compatible service available for file storage [Source: architecture/3-backend-services.md]
- **Authentication**: Must integrate with OAuth2/JWT authentication system [Source: architecture/3-backend-services.md]

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Following standard Node.js/NestJS testing patterns recommended:
- **Test Framework**: Jest or similar for unit testing
- **Test Location**: Likely `src/test/` directory based on current structure
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests for all service methods and API endpoints
